Zorbing involves rolling a person down a hill in a large inflatable ball. The ball is typically made of transparent plastic and can hold one or two people. The objective of the activity is to roll the ball from one end of the course to the other as quickly as possible while keeping the ball under control.

How To Set Up Zorbing Competition

2. **Rent the Zorbing balls**: Rent the Zorbing balls from a reputable company and ensure that they are in good condition.
3. **Divide into teams**: Divide the participants into teams of 4-6 people. Mix up the teams so that people who don't normally work together have the opportunity to interact.
4. **Practice**: Allow each team to practice rolling the Zorbing ball down the hill to get used to the experience.
5. **Race**: Set up a race where each team competes against each other to see who can roll the ball from one end of the course to the other as quickly as possible. The team with the fastest time wins the race.
6. **Debrief**: After the race, bring the teams back together for a debrief. Ask them to share what they learned about working together, communication, and trust during the race.
