What Is a Golf Outing?

A Golf Outing is an outdoor activity in which teams play a round of golf together. The activity promotes communication, teamwork, and friendly competition as teams work together to navigate the course and score the lowest number of strokes.

How To Set Up a Golf Outing
---------------------------

Here are the steps to set up a Golf Outing:

1. **Choose a location**: Choose a golf course that is accessible and appropriate for your team's skill level.
2. **Divide into teams**: Divide the participants into teams of 4-6 people. Mix up the teams so that people who don't normally work together have the opportunity to interact.
3. **Plan the game**: Plan the game format, such as best ball or scramble, and communicate the rules and scoring system to all participants.
4. **Play the game**: Have the teams play their round of golf together, encouraging communication, teamwork, and problem-solving during the game.
5. **Score and declare the winner**: Have a scoring system in place and declare the winning team based on the lowest number of strokes.
6. **Debrief**: After the game, bring the teams back together for a debrief. Ask them to share what they learned about working together, communication, and problem-solving during the outing.
