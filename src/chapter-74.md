What Is Wilderness Survival Training?

Wilderness Survival Training is a team-building activity that simulates a survival situation in a wilderness environment. The goal is to work together as a team to overcome challenges such as building shelter, finding food and water, and navigating terrain. The activity promotes problem-solving, communication, and collaboration as participants learn to work together towards a common goal while facing adversity.

How To Set Up Wilderness Survival Training

Here are the steps to set up Wilderness Survival Training:

1. **Choose a location**: Choose a location that has enough space to accommodate the teams and allows for wilderness activities such as hiking, camping, or orienteering.
2. **Prepare the materials**: Prepare the necessary materials such as maps, compasses, tents, sleeping bags, and other outdoor equipment.
3. **Divide into teams**: Divide the participants into equal teams of 4-6 people. Mix up the teams so that people who don't normally work together have the opportunity to interact.
4. **Assign tasks**: Assign each team a specific survival-related task such as building a shelter, starting a fire, finding water, or gathering food.
5. **Conduct the activity**: Conduct the activity by having each team work together to complete their assigned task. Encourage problem-solving, communication, and collaboration between team members.
6. **Debrief**: After the activity, bring the teams back together for a debrief. Ask them to share their experiences and feedback on the activity and how they plan to apply what they learned in their work.
